    "The US Census provides additonal data on household types. Family vs non-family. Family house holds can be either heterosexual married couples are single parents with children. Non family households can be homosexual couples without kids or single men/women. The data sets can be found [here](https://www.census.gov/data/tables/time-series/demo/income-poverty/cps-hinc/hinc-04.html).\n",
    "This data is taken from 2017 and cites 127 million households. The zip code data set we loaded from the american fact finder cited 120 million households. The discrepancy is reasonable given that the american fact finder uses a five year estimate (thus averages the past 5 years to get a rolling 5 year average for each year). We will be using the 2017 census data as a means for understanding the percentage distribution of households that contain women, so the discrepancy in counts shouldn't affect the end result. The methodology used was to gather 5 separate data sets: married-couple family households, female house holder (no spouse), male house holder (no spouse), nonfamily female householder, and nonfamily male householder.\n",
    "Then, of the total count of households within each bucket we assumed that only married households or female headed-households contain. The result gleaned from slicing the data this way is that 12.4% of households are either single dads with children or male householders with no spouse present. If we multiply all our household counts by .876, then we retain the count of households which contain women."
